          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            As the fastest reindeer at the North Pole, you have more than lived up to your name. Despite your phenomenal speed, you take your position on Santa's sleigh 
            team very seriously. You are aware that there are many reindeer vying to be on the team and it angers you when members of the team take their position lightly. 
            In particular, Rudolph has become spoiled and lazy in recent years.<br><br>

            With the growing population and increased demand for toys, Santa has announced that she will be making some changes to increase both productivity in the workshop 
            and speed on the sleigh team. After this announcement, Bouncy suggested that Rudolph be removed from the sleigh team and replaced by Dusty, a doe with amazing speed. 
            However, Jingle would not suggest this to Santa, due to Santa's favoritism for Rudolph. This angered you not only because Jingle's decision will slow the sleigh down, 
            but it may also put Bouncy's position in jeopardy.<br><br>

            As for Santa's concerns about toy production, you believe productivity would improve if Santa replaced Jangle. Jangle is in charge of the toy plans and designs. 
            Someone with new skills is more capable of designing toys that could be produced faster. While you have always prided yourself on your speed, lately it seems to have done 
            you a disservice. Just last week, Hermey was recklessly trampled by a reindeer, leaving him in a coma. With little evidence to go on in the investigation led by Jingle, some 
            believe you are the prime suspect because of your speed. To avoid being wrongly convicted, you have done everything you can to clear your name. A guilty verdict would remove 
            you from the sleigh team—something you cannot bear.<br><br>

            Until your name is cleared from any suspicion as the culprit in Hermey's accident and other North Pole logistics are figured out, you have no time for love. Cupid is hurt by your 
            recent lack of attention. However, before you can truly commit to Cupid, you want to make sure your position on the sleigh team is secure. If you were to be removed from the sleigh 
            team, you fear that Cupid will no longer love you.<br><br>

            With the Holly, Jolly Christmas Party right around the corner, you are anxious to attend. With everyone in attendance, you believe it will be the perfect place to clear your name from 
            any suspicion. Additionally, you want to shift the pressure off of the sleigh speed and back onto the productivity of the workshop—where it should be!

          <h4>Acting Your Part</h4>
          <p>As a hard-working and diligent reindeer, you plan to use your time at the party to try to prove your innocence and clear your name from any suspicion in Hermey's accident investigation. 
            Be very defensive when people ask you about your whereabouts and be suspicious of your fellow reindeer.

            For the party, you will dress in your reindeer attire, which may include brown or tan clothing, antlers, a black nose, reindeer bells and, possibly, your most festive Christmas sweater.
