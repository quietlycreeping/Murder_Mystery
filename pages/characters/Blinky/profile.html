          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            As one of the most diligent elves in the North Pole, you have observed the decline in productivity first hand. Over the years, Santa has worked hard 
            to create and maintain a very lucrative operation by making wise choices and delegating responsibilities to competent individuals. Recently, however, 
            many of the individuals Santa appointed have become inattentive, lazy and no longer care as they once did—in particular, Jingle and Rudolph. 
            Earlier this week, Santa announced that she would be investigating to find out what changes can be made to increase both the sleigh speed and toy workshop productivity.<br><br>

            Angered by the fact that Jingle is no longer taking her job as head elf seriously, you have started a campaign to become the next head elf. Among your actions, 
            you have taken on leadership roles within the workshop and started romancing Connie Claus as a way to get closer to Santa. While your relationship with Connie 
            started with questionable intentions, you have fallen in love with her. Even though others construe Connie's distaste for Jingle and Rudolph as jealousy, Connie 
            shares your view that both Jingle and Rudolph are bad influences on Santa Claus. Desiring to maintain a sense of privacy, you decided to keep your love a secret from others.<br><br>

            While your campaign to gain power at the North Pole appeared to be working, you became worried when you found out that Santa intended to have Kristy Krangle marry Connie. 
            Believing that Santa would not consent to a marriage proposal from you, Connie insisted that the two of you be secretly married and you agreed. As Connie's husband, you now 
            have your sights set on not only becoming the head elf, but one day inheriting the “Santa Claus” legacy. Even though you do not like keeping secrets, out of love for Connie 
            you have agreed to keep your marriage a secret until she is ready to reveal her marital status.<br><br>

            With the Christmas season well on its way, you are looking forward to the Holly, Jolly Christmas Party. At the party, not only do you plan to demonstrate to Santa why you 
            would be a good choice to become the next head elf, but you are also hoping that Connie will announce your marriage. You can't wait!

          <h4>Acting Your Part</h4>
          <p>As a diligent and hard-working elf, you have your sights set on becoming the next head elf (and, inevitably, inheriting Santa's legacy). 
            With that in mind, you will want to do anything you can to impress Santa while at the party, including trying to resolve some of her stress 
            by assuring her you will take care of her daughter and increase toy production.

          <h4>Costumes Suggestions</h4>
          <p>
            As a toy elf who works in the workshop, you will want to dress in your elf attire, which may include: striped stockings, 
            toe-curved shoes, pointed ears, a hat and plenty of red and green accessories. Along with your attire, do not forget your 
            toolbox filled with toy-making tools.
