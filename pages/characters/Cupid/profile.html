          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            As one of the reindeer on Santa's coveted sleigh team, you enjoy your status at the North Pole immensely. It gives you great joy to be part of the sleigh team that 
            annually delivers toys and gifts to the children of the world. Additionally, you get great satisfaction from the comradeship you have with your teammates and you feel 
            as though you have found the love of your life on the sleigh team, Comet.<br><br>

            While the members of the sleigh team have remained constant for many years, this year may be different. With the growing global population and increasing demand for toys, 
            Santa is very worried that the current toy production and sleigh speed will not be adequate to meet demand. Because of this, Santa has stated that she will be making some 
            changes to increase efficiency on all fronts. This has many elves and reindeer, including you, worried for their positions.<br><br>

            To help ease the worry, you have secretly been participating in speed drills with Dusty who hopes to one day join the sleigh team. You feel these drills will give you an added 
            advantage over your teammates if one of you is to be replaced because of your speed. Recently, Rudolph has been very flirtatious with you. You have shunned Rudolph's advances and 
            let him and others know that you are in love with Comet.<br><br>

            When Comet found out about your love for her, she professed the same feelings of affection for you. However, your relationship has not progressed, partly because of the recent elf 
            incident. Just last week, Hermey was trampled by a reindeer, leaving him in a coma and Hermey's wife, Ivy, full of grief. Santa has vowed to take flying rights away from the guilty 
            reindeer. Currently, Comet is the prime suspect because of her amazing speed, but she claims to be innocent. Ever since the accident, Comet has been doing everything to clear her name, 
            but it does not seem to be working.<br><br>

            A heart-strong reindeer, you are not the only one in the North Pole who has commitment and marriage on your mind. Recently, you befriended Connie Clause who suggested to you that she is 
            secretly in love. However, you overheard Mr. Claus talking about her marriage wishes for Connie. While Mr. Claus wants Connie to marry for true love, she also wants Connie to marry someone 
            who can take over Santa's duties when Santa retires. As part of this plan, Santa has recruited Kristy Krangle to come and court Connie. While you applaud their efforts, Kristy and Connie 
            have little in common including romantic chemistry. It is clear to you that Mr. Claus and Santa's first priority is Santa's legacy, not Connie's happiness.<br><br>

            As the Holly, Jolly Christmas Party is quickly approaching, you are happy to attend. With everyone in attendance, you think it will be the perfect place to search out the true culprit for 
            Hermey's incident. Additionally, you hope the festive spirit will help Comet to forget her worries and enjoy some time together!

          <h4>Acting Your Part</h4>
          <p>As a heart-strong reindeer, you are looking forward to the party to spend some time with your girlfriend, Comet. You plan to use the party to get Comet to loosen up and commit to you. 
            Additionally, you are very intrusive and curious about the romantic relationships of your peers. You hope the Holly, Jolly Christmas Party will create a laid back atmosphere where you can gossip about relationships.
