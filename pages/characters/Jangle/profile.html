          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            As the head toy-designing elf, Santa  has relied on you to produce the most current and creative toy designs over the years. A large part of Santa's legacy 
            relies on how the toys are both designed and produced by North Pole elves. As time has gone on, you have continued to develop toy design plans and kept up with 
            the changing demands of new generations.<br><br>

            With the growing global population's demand for more toys at Christmas, there are rumors at the North Pole that the demand for toys may exceed production this year. 
            While you fear this may happen, you do not believe (as some would suggest) that your toy designs are the problem. You believe the real fault lies in some of the individuals 
            that have grown lazy in their duties over the years, in particular, Jingle.<br><br>

            Earlier this week, Santa announced she would be investigating to find solutions for increasing productivity. Santa says she will be implementing changes she believes are needed. 
            Fearing being replaced as toy designer, you contacted Matteo (a leading toy manufacturer) to see if they would want to buy exclusive rights to your toy designs, and to hire you on 
            as a toy designer. While you prefer to stay with your friends in the North Pole, if your skills will not be appreciated, you will go elsewhere. In the midst of brokering a deal with 
            Matteo, some correspondence accidentally got delivered to Jingle and she learned of your plan. Quickly, you convinced Jingle that she needed you on her side to continue as head elf. 
            Jingle agreed to keep quiet about your plans, but only if you gave her a portion of your profits. You agreed, but only to keep Jingle from telling anyone of your deal.<br><br>

            Luckily, there has been a great deal of commotion at the North Pole to deflect attention away from you. Currently, both Blinky and Sparky  both hope to replace Jingle as head elf. 
            You have witnessed Blinky secretly sneaking off with Connie Claus . Knowing Blinky as a ruthless elf, you believe Blinky may be using Connie only to get closer to Santa. You believe this 
            plan may backfire since Santa desires for Connie to marry Kristy Krangle.<br><br>

            With the Holly, Jolly Christmas Party quickly approaching, you are looking forward to attending. At the party, you hope to convince others that your toy designs are not the cause for the 
            North Pole operations' lack of productivity. Additionally, you plan to discredit Jingle at the party, so that if she does divulge your secret, you can paint her as a dishonest elf.

          <h4>Acting Your Part</h4>
          <p>
            As an elf who fears losing their position, you are very gracious and outgoing towards others. You plan to use the party to collect and spread any information that you can to discredit Jingle's character.

          <h4>Costumes Suggestions</h4>
          <p>
            For the party you will want to dress in your elf attire. Among things you will want to consider for your outfit are: striped stockings, Christmas sweaters, Christmas-themed accessories, a vest, 
            curve-toed shoes, pointed ears, a hat, and any red and green accessories. Along with your outfit, you will want to bring some tools for toy-making and toy-designing, such as a compass, protractor, toy plans, etc.
