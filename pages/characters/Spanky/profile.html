          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            Because you are an impeccable judge of character, you are the elf in charge of creating and updating the “naughty” and “nice” lists, which Santa uses when preparing the gifts everyone should receive at Christmas.<br><br>
            Despite popular opinion, there are some people who unexpectedly have been put on your “naughty” list, including some of Santa's closest confidants. Among the surprising names on the naughty list are Rudolph , Kristy Krangle  and Jingle . Although Santa has always run a very efficient and lucrative operation at the North Pole, lately these individuals have been taking advantage of their positions of privilege. It appears that this year some of Santa's confidants are not working as hard as they could be to make Christmas a wonderful and spectacular holiday. While many coworkers believe that Connie Claus  is a bitter soul and should be on the “naughty” list, you have placed her on the “nice” list. Connie has also observed that Santa's closest friends are those who are ruining her reputation. You believe that Connie is simply working hard to help Santa, but many see Connie's resentment of Jingle, Rudolph and Kristy as a jealous power grab.<br><br>
            Normally, you have an impeccable ability to see the inherent good and evil in one's personality, but you are perplexed by Dusty, a young doe vying to be awarded a position on the sleigh team. Although all of the signs indicate that Dusty has a good heart and soul, you have observed her sneaking off lately with Cupid . You have decided to reserve judgment on both Dusty and Cupid until you have more information.<br><br>
            Since the start of the Christmas season, tension in the North Pole has been rising. The mounting stress is due to the fact that Santa has announced she will be reviewing the North Pole processes and will be making adjustments to increase productivity. Along with many reindeer and elves desperate to keep their jobs or be promoted in both the workshop and on the sleigh team, you are no different.<br><br>
            With the Holly, Jolly Christmas Party right around the corner, you are looking forward to attending. At the party, you plan to observe others and gain information that will help you finalize your “naughty” and “nice” lists. Since many jobs are on the line, you plan to use your position of influence over Santa to advance yourself financially and in job security at the North Pole.

            At the party, you will need to be ready to take over and conduct an investigation if something happens. For the party, you will want to dress in your seasonal and festive elf attire. Among things you will want to consider for your outfit are: striped stockings, Christmas sweaters, Christmas-themed accessories, a vest, your toy-making tools, curve-toed shoes, pointed ears, a hat, and any red and green accessories.
