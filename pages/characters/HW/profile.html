          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            As the postmaster at the North Pole, you control the correspondence between the North Pole and the outside world. As a job, you find your position very rewarding 
            because of the amount of love and care that the children put into their letters to Santa. You gain much satisfaction in making sure the letters are received and read promptly. 
            While most of the mail you deliver are children's “wish lists” to Santa, you have seen some rather odd correspondence this year.<br><br>

            First, you saw a letter from the Justice of the Peace directed to the North Pole. Since the elves and reindeer are typically joined in union by Santa, you find it odd that the 
            Justice of the Peace would be writing to someone at the North Pole. You wonder what other reason the magistrate may have for addressing someone here. In looking for the correct 
            recipient, you asked Cupid  about the letter. She denied that the letter was in regards to a union she hoped to strike with Comet . Before you could identify the correct recipient 
            of the letter, it disappeared. You can only hope that the rightful owner claimed it.<br><br>

            Additionally, you came across a letter from Matteo, a major toy company, addressed to Jingle. Recently Santa has made it clear that she wishes to increase output in the workshop, and 
            that she will implement changes to achieve this goal. You worry that Jingle may be outsourcing toy plans from Matteo to help Santa meet her goal and ensure her own position as head elf 
            remains intact. A large part of Santa's legacy rests on the fact that the toys Santa delivers are designed and built by North Pole elves. If toy designs and production plans were found 
            to be outsourced, Jingle would be putting Santa's legacy at risk.<br><br>

            While you do not agree with Jingle's tactics, you have decided to keep them a secret and use the information to your advantage. Believing that Santa would have Jingle demoted if she found 
            out about her wrong-doings, you plan to blackmail Jingle. It will be interesting to see how much she is willing to sacrifice to keep this secret. With both Blinky and Sparky vying for the 
            head elf position, you have no doubt Jingle will pay a healthy price for the same information. If they refuse, you intend to sell the information to one of Jingle's adversaries. Blinky is a 
            rather ambitious elf who will do anything to be promoted. Recently you have witnessed Blinky romancing Connie Claus in order to grow closer to Santa, and potentially closer to the position of head elf.<br><br>

            With the Holly, Jolly Christmas Party quickly approaching, you are excited to attend. Since all of the North Pole inhabitants will be present, it will be the perfect opportunity to use your knowledge to your advantage!

          <h4>Acting Your Part</h4>
          <p>
            While at the party do not be afraid to mingle with others and learn of the happenings at the North Pole. 
            Insist that learning this information will only help you to do your job and, thus, help Santa meet her goal of having a more efficient North Pole operation.

          <h4>Costumes Suggestions</h4>
          <p>
            As the North Pole postmaster, you will want to come to the party dressed in your uniform—complete with your hat, buttoned down coat, and your mail bag 
            filled with letters from the girls and boys of the world.
