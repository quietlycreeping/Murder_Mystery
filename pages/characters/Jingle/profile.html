          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            As the head elf, you consider yourself a key element to the success of the North Pole. While Santa is ultimately in charge, she often relies heavily on 
            your input and suggestions to make decisions. As the North Pole operations have grown over time, so have your duties. While you oversee everything, you 
            have delegated many of the responsibilities from the toy design (taken care of by Jangle) to the reindeer care and training (taken care of by Bouncy).<br><br>

            Currently, Santa has also placed you in charge of an accident investigation. A week ago, Hermey was carelessly trampled by a reindeer leaving him in a coma. 
            The guilty party has not come forward to accept responsibility for the wrongdoing and it is your duty to find and reprimand the culprit by removing their flying privileges. 
            Because of her speed, Comet is the main suspect followed closely by Rudolph . With both reindeer being an integral part of the Christmas Eve sleigh team, you hope that the 
            true culprit will turn out to be another reindeer. Being one of Santa's favorites, having to reprimand Rudolph would upset Santa greatly—something you do not wish to do. 
            Conversely, it would please Bouncy  if Rudolph were removed from the sleigh team. Bouncy insists that Dusty  is faster and a harder worker, but you refuse to replace Rudolph 
            unless he is found guilty.<br><br>

            Unfortunately with the growing global population and desire for more toys, the demand is starting to exceed the production at the North Pole. This has Santa concerned about the 
            need to improve sleigh speed and the productivity in the workshop. While you have assured Santa that you are doing everything to maximize productivity, Santa has insisted that a 
            formal investigation occur to identify discrepancies and needed improvements.<br><br>

            After Santa's announcement, many elves and reindeer have been very apprehensive about the changes that will be made. Just the other day, you overheard Blinky and Sparky  talking 
            and both are vying for your position as head elf. Additionally, you discovered that Jangle  was in talks with Matteo (a toy producer) about selling the original toy plans for millions 
            of dollars. Worried about your own job security, you promised Jangle that you would keep their secret if Jangle would give you a share of their profits.<br><br>

            One reason you believe Santa may be pushing hard for change is because she plans to retire soon and has worries about who might manage her legacy. Ultimately, Santa wishes to keep her 
            legacy within her family, but she is not willing to hand over operations solely to her daughter. Connie has always been jealous of the time Santa devotes to the children of the world over 
            her, and, because of this, Connie does not possess a great deal of Christmas spirit. Santa has hand-picked Kristy Krangle as her protégé and a courter to Connie. Santa is hoping that Kristy 
            will marry Connie and Santa may then pass the legacy on to her daughter-in-law (Kristy Krangle). To the contrary, you hope this does not happen. With Kristy at the helm, your job security may be in jeopardy.<br><br>

            As the season is getting underway, you are looking forward to the Holly, Jolly Christmas Party! You think it will be a great way to boost morale amongst the elves and reindeer at the North Pole. 
            Additionally, you hope to reassure Santa of your leadership competency.

          <h4>Acting Your Part</h4>
          <p>
            As the head elf, you always want to appear as if you are in charge. At the party, you will be confident and deliberate in your actions. Moreover, you will do everything in your power to convince 
            Santa she needs you to continue as “head elf,” if she hopes to meet her goals of increasing North Pole efficiency this year.

          <h4>Costumes Suggestions</h4>
          <p>
            To the party, you will want to dress in your elf attire. Among things you will want to consider for your outfit are: striped stockings, Christmas sweaters, Christmas-themed accessories, a vest, 
            pointed shoes, a hat, and other red and green accessories
