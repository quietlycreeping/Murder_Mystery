          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            As a very diligent and dedicated elf at the North Pole, you have always gone above and beyond to do whatever Jingle  has asked. Over the years, you came to 
            believe that Jingle was training you to follow in her footsteps and become the “head elf.” Because of this, you continued to work hard without any complaints. 
            However, recently you realized that Jingle assigned you extra work so that their girlfriend would have little or no work in the toy factory.<br><br>

            Angered by this realization, you started an independent campaign to become head elf. With the increase in global population and the rising demand for toys, Santa 
            is increasingly concerned about toy production. While Jangle  is getting much of the blame for Santa's workshop not keeping pace with the demand for toys, you believe 
            the loss of productivity is a result of Jingle's mismanagement of the workshop. You are confident you can increase productivity by efficiently and effectively managing 
            the workshop without showing favoritism.<br><br>

            Unfortunately, Blinky  has also been vying for the head elf position but has used other tactics to promote himself. Blinky has been secretly romancing Connie Claus. 
            Blinky assumes incorrectly that Connie has some influence over Santa's decisions. Coincidentally, you believe this strategy may backfire on Blinky. However, Santa does 
            not like it when people keep secrets, nor will she be happy that Blinky is using Connie for her position. In addition, Blinky's actions are undermining Santa's wish for 
            Connie to marry Kristy Krangle. Knowing that Mr. Claus is equally concerned about the future of the North Pole operations, you plan to recruit his support. From your observations, 
            you have learned that Mr. Claus will do just about anything to make sure Santa's reputation is preserved.<br><br>

            As the Holly, Jolly Christmas Party approaches, you are looking forward to attending. With all of the inhabitants of the North Pole present, you believe it will be a great place to 
            highlight your leadership abilities and prove to Santa that you would be a great “head elf.” Additionally, you are filled with Christmas spirit and you can't wait to share it!

          <h4>Acting Your Part</h4>
          <p>
            Since you are advocating for a promotion, you will want to be very outgoing, positive, and direct in your nature. At the party you will want to win over your associates with your charm and willingness to please.

          <h4>Costumes Suggestions</h4>
          <p>
            At the party, you will want to dress in your seasonal and festive elf attire. Among things you will want to consider for your outfit are: striped stockings, Christmas sweaters, Christmas-themed accessories, 
            a vest, your toy-making tools, curve-toed shoes, pointed ears, a hat, and any red and green accessories.
