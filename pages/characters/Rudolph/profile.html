          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            As a young fawn, you thought that you were cursed with a “glowing red nose.” Then one foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say, “Rudolph with your nose so bright, 
            won't you guide my sleigh tonight?” After that, you were considered a hero, not only at the North Pole, but throughout the universe.<br><br>

            Year after year, you have continued to guide Santa's sleigh on Christmas Eve and have become a global legend. Along with your popularity, your ego and your sense of 
            entitlement has increased, while your work ethic and speed have decreased. Angered by your laziness and unwillingness to work, Bouncy has suggested that you be replaced 
            on the sleigh team by Dusty. However, because of your legacy with Santa and your friendship with Jingle, she refuses to suggest that solution to Santa.<br><br>

            Another person that you have befriended to protect your interests is Kristy Krangle. Like Jingle, Kristy is one of Santa's close confidants who has learned to favor you in order 
            to keep Santa happy. Thus, you are in support of Kristy taking on Santa's duties when she retires. Unfortunately, Santa intends for Kristy to marry Connie Claus before she will turn 
            over her legacy to Kristy. However, due to Connie's jealousy of your tight relationship with Santa, Connie is not fond of either you or Kristy.<br><br>

            Like Kristy, you have romantic troubles of your own. You are smitten by Cupid and despite your romantic advances, she is not flattered by your attention and has stated that she is in love 
            with Comet. You have warned Cupid that Comet may be a very dangerous reindeer.<br><br>

            Just last week, there was a late night accident where Hermey was trampled by a reindeer. While there is limited evidence, Comet's speed has made her the prime suspect. Coincidentally, your 
            own memories of that fateful night are lost, leaving your innocence in question. Earlier that evening, you and Blitzen were drinking eggnog behind the barn,a prohibited activity. In the morning, 
            you were unable to recall your late night actions. Together, you and Blitzen vowed to alibi one another, citing that you were working together on speed drills at the time of the accident.<br><br>

            As the Christmas season is underway, you are excited about the upcoming Holly, Jolly Christmas Party. Since Santa has vowed to make some changes to increase productivity in the North Pole this year, 
            many elves and reindeer are on edge. As one of Santa's favorites, you feel your job is secure and you are looking forward to the celebration. Additionally, you will be looking for ways to incriminate 
            Comet as the culprit in Hermey's accident. If you can prove that Comet is guilty, you will not only clear your name, but you may gain some affection from Cupid!
