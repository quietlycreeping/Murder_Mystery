          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            As the one and only apprentice at the North Pole, you are honored to be hand-picked by Santa to learn about the daily operations. You believe that Santa is 
            training you to eventually run the North Pole when she retiresâ€”a fact you couldn't be more proud of. Originally, you thought that you were selected by Santa 
            for the tremendous level of Christmas spirit you have exhibited throughout your life. After arriving at the North Pole, it is clear that Santa also chose you 
            because of your background in business operations and management.<br><br>

            With the changing times, increase in population and advances in toy technology, Santa is concerned that the North Pole may not be able to keep up with demand for toys. 
            Santa is looking for ways to increase creativity in toy design, as well as efficiency, and output. While you have assured Santa that you are the one for the job, she has 
            yet to turn all of her secrets over to you. Although you work closely with Santa, it is apparent that she trusts Jingle  more than you, so you are looking for a way to 
            change that. One way you have attempted to grow closer to Santa is by befriending Santa's favorite reindeer, Rudolph. Rudolph has welcomed your friendship and the two of 
            you have vowed to help each other out. Additionally, you think that you can earn Santa's trust by solving some of her efficiency problems and by resolving a dispute between 
            the elves and the reindeer. Just last week a elf was recklessly trampled by a reindeer, leaving him in a coma. Since the culprit has yet to come forward and admit guilt, the 
            elves are very upset that no one has been reprimanded for their wrongdoing. Jingle is currently in charge of the investigation, but you believe you will be looked upon positively 
            if you are able to help out the investigation.<br><br>

            Recently you also learned that Santa expects that you will marry her daughter, Connie Claus. While Connie is a lovely girl, the two of you have little in common, but you hope to make your love grow over time.<br><br>

            With the Holly, Jolly Christmas Party right around the corner, you are excited to attend. Since all of the North Pole inhabitants will be present, it will be the perfect place to 
            gain information on how to better run the workshop, to grow closer with Santa, and to work on romancing Connie Claus!

          <h4>Acting Your Part</h4>
          <p>
            As one of the newest inhabitants to the North Pole, you are a bit of a brownnoser. You will want to get on the good side of everyone. In order to do this, be polite, engaging, and flattering to each of the party-goers. 
            Additionally, it is important that you spend time trying to impress Connie Claus, since you are destined to marry her.

      <!--Dressing-->  
        <div class="card card-body">
          <h4>Costumes Suggestions</h4>
          <p>
            At the party you will want to show your Christmas spirit by wearing as much red and green as possible. You may want to consider wearing a gaudy or festive Christmas sweater. Being a North Pole inhabitant, 
            your outfit should consist of very warm attire such as stockings, scarf, mittens or a sweater adorned with fur trim.
