          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            As one of Santa's elves, you lead a very simple and fulfilling life at the North Pole. Your days consist of working in the workshop and your evenings are spent hanging out with your husband and fellow elves. Growing up at the North Pole, you have never felt anything but love and camaraderie for your fellow inhabitantsâ€”until recently.<br><br>
            Earlier in the week, your husband, Hermey, went out for a drink of eggnog. When Hermey didn't return, you went looking for him only to find him lying in the snow, trampled by a reindeer. Immediately, you had Hermey taken to the infirmary where he still lays in a coma.<br><br>
            Not only does it sadden you that such an accident could happen at the North Pole, but you are upset that no one from your close-knit community has stepped forward to take responsibility for the accident. Along with her many duties, Santa  has assigned Jingle to direct an investigation of the accident and reprimand the culprit by removing any flying privileges from the guilty party. Because Santa is also pressuring Jingle to increase toy production and sleigh speed, you worry that the investigation will not only be slow, but compromised as well. In particular, if the culprit is a reindeer who will help increase the Christmas Eve sleigh speed, the offender will, most likely, not be properly sanctioned. Thus, you suspect one of the fastest reindeer,Comet, is the leading suspect.<br><br>
            Frustrated with the slowness of the investigation, you have started to investigate the accident yourself. You have enlisted the help of Dusty, a rather ambitious young doe who desires to be on the sleigh team.<br><br> 
            With your husband still in a coma, you do not feel like celebrating, but you are looking forward to the Holly, Jolly Christmas Party. At the party you plan to question everyone about their whereabouts the night your husband was trampled. Hopefully, your diligence in the matter will cause a breakthrough in the investigation and you will be able to identify the true culprit!

          <h4>Acting Your Part</h4>
          <p>As a grief-stricken spouse, you are first and foremost concerned about the health of your husband, Hermey. Tainted and angered by the slow pace of the investigation into Hermey's accident, you will be assertive and direct with everyone you meet at the party in hopes of revealing hidden information. Do not be afraid to question elves or reindeer and call them out on any discrepancies in their stories.</p>

          <p>
            For the party, you will want to dress in your seasonal elf attire. Among things you will want to consider for your outfit are: striped stockings, Christmas sweaters, Christmas-themed accessories, a vest, curve toed shoes, pointed ears, a hat, and any red and green accessories.
