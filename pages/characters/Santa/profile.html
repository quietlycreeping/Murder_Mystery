          As Santa Claus, you have brought joy and happiness to the little boys and girls of the world for many years.<br><br>

          While your lifestyle is generally perceived as holly and jolly, there is a great deal of stress that comes with your position. As the official head of the North Pole
          operations, your responsibilities include overseeing everything from toy-making design and production to reindeer health and sleigh operation. On top of your traditional 
          “Santa” duties, you are also responsible for the happiness of your own family and the preservation of your legacy.<br><br>
           
          As time goes on, your job has been getting more and more difficult. With the increasing population, new technology, and growing materialism and greediness of the children today, 
          the demand and expectations are starting to exceed the production of your workshop—something you cannot tolerate. This fact causes you to worry that your legacy may be in jeopardy if 
          you can't continue to keep up delivery to all the children desiring toys.<br><br>

          After thinking about how to improve the efficiency of the North Pole, you have issued a memo to the North Pole inhabitants making it clear that you will be reviewing all of the policies 
          and procedures and implementing changes in the near future. Among the changes, you expect that you will be demoting and promoting some elves and/or reindeer in order to keep up with current 
          production levels demanded by the changing world. Many of the elves and reindeer have taken your plan to heart and you are glad to see that they also care deeply about improving efficiency in 
          the North Pole.<br><br>

          While you plan to carry out a fair review, you can't help but feel some bias towards those who have helped significantly in creating your Christmas magic, including Rudolph  and Jingle. 
          It is no secret that you depend on Rudolph to guide your sleigh each year. With sleigh speed being a factor in your review process, you will have to weigh Rudolph's loyalty versus his ability to 
          improve his speed, pace and stamina. Additionally, Jingle has been your right-hand elf for many years and lightens your workload immensely. Jingle often reviews both the reindeer sled team and 
          the workshop and decides who fills which positions. Jingle, along with the toy designer, Jangle, have always manufactured highly creative and original toys that are not found or produced anywhere 
          but in your workshop, a key to your legacy. Additionally, you have Jingle do many duties you do not wish to handle. Currently, Jingle is heading up an investigation into an incident where an elf, 
          Hermey, was found trampled in the snow leaving him in a coma. The preliminary evidence suggests that the incident is the fault of a careless reindeer. Not wanting to personally upset anyone, you put 
          Jingle in charge of finding the individual responsible for Hermey's accident and punishing them, which will include removing their flying privileges. In addition to your favorites, you also plan to 
          question Blinky quite closely. Lately Blinky has been acting very strange and you worry that he may be up to no good.<br><br>

          While the level of stress in your current situation is high, so is the stress regarding the future. In the next few years, you would like to retire and watch your legacy 
          continue in the hands of someone else. Many years ago, you and Mr. Claus had a daughter, and you were hoping Connie would fill your shoes in some way.<br><br>

          Unfortunately, over the years Connie has become resentful of the amount of time you spend on other kids and the fame you have developed around the world. Fearing that Connie's heart is not filled 
          with the Christmas spirit, you do not feel comfortable passing your duties onto her. In an attempt to keep your business within the family, you have sought out the perfect courter for Connie, 
          Kristy Krangle. Currently, Kristy is living and working at the North Pole as your apprentice. Kristy is a woman that both embodies the Christmas spirit and possesses a mind for business that you 
          believe will be able to keep the North Pole operations up-to-date and moving forward. Despite your fondness for Kristy, you are not willing to turn over all of the secrets of the North Pole to her 
          until she and Connie are married. You are worried about Connie's lack of affection for Kristy, but you believe that over time their relationship will grow.<br><br>

          While everything currently seems to be in turmoil at the North Pole, you believe the best way to increase productivity is to spread some Christmas cheer. With that in mind, you have planned a 
          Holly, Jolly Christmas Party to lift everyone's spirits and unite all of the North Pole inhabitants. At the party, you will want to work hard to ensure everyone remains happy while you sort out 
          the changes that need to be made in the workshop and on the sleigh team.<br><br>

        <div class="card card-body">
          As the leader of the North Pole operations, you will want to be both authoritative and kind to your guests. While you realize that everyone 
          does contribute to making the North Pole mission successful, your legacy is on the line and you want everyone to remember that.

          To the party, you will want to come dressed in a red suit adorned with white fur. If you do not already have a beard, white hair, 
          and a plump belly, those are essential ingredients for your costume and identity.
