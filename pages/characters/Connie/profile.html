          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            As the daughter of Santa Claus, many would think that your life has been nothing but a toy-filled paradise of fun, love and affection. However, you do not see it that way. While Santa is one of the most giving women on the planet, she has not shown you the affection that you have desired. Santa often puts her work first and provides for the needs of other children before your own. As the global population of children has grown and toy technology has improved, Santa has continued to neglect your relationship. Additionally, when Santa does have some spare time, you have witnessed her spending it with her closest confidants—Rudolph and Jingle. This fact has made you even more resentful and jealous of Jingle and Rudolph. You are constantly looking for ways to disrupt their relationship with Santa. Just recently, Blitzen confided in you that he believes Rudolph is to blame for an accident where Hermey was trampled by a reindeer. If you can prove this to be true, Santa will be forced to remove Rudolph from the sleigh team. However, you worry that Jingle may be helping with a cover-up to protect Rudolph.<br><br>
            Despite your strained relationship with Santa you do feel a sense of entitlement. Your parents have worked hard at building Santa's legacy and you are confident they wish to keep the North Pole operations within the family. Currently, both Santa and Mr. Claus have been working endlessly to restore productivity in the workshop and keep the sleigh speed up so that Santa's legacy does not falter or diminish. Fearing that Santa would force you to marry Kristy Krangle to help protect her legacy, you have secretly wed Blinky, an elf you have fallen in love with. While some believe that Blinky may be using you for your position in the family, you disagree.<br><br>
            As a sucker for true love, you have befriended Cupid, a heart-strong reindeer. Cupid has told you of her love for Comet, but you have witnessed Cupid secretly sneaking off with Dusty. Cupid's actions confuse you and you do not know if you can trust her. Additionally, Comet has been acting strangely around Cupid. You have assured Cupid that Comet's odd behavior is most likely due to the stress of the holidays, although secretly you wonder if Comet may be hiding something from Cupid.<br><br>
            As the Christmas season is just getting underway, you are excited to attend the Holly, Jolly Christmas Party. While at the party, you plan to look for ways to earn your mother's attention and distance her from others, in particular Jingle and Rudolph. Even though you feel that your place as the next matriarch of the North Pole is certain, you would like to guarantee it any way you can!<br><br>

          <h4>Acting Your Part</h4>
          <p>
            As the daughter of Santa, you are jealous of those close to Santa. You will be rather rude to those with tight relationships with her—in particular, Rudolph, Jingle and Kristy Krangle.

          <h4>Costumes Suggestions</h4>
          <p>
            However, in order to show your Christmas spirit, you will wear as much red and green as possible, and may even consider an over-the-top Christmas sweater. Being an inhabitant of the North Pole, your outfit may also consist of very warm attire such as stockings, mittens, scarf or a sweater adorned with fur trim.
