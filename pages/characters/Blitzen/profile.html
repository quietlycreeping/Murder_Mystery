          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            As one of the reindeer on Santa's sleigh team, you have always held a position of privilege in the North Pole. As you have aged, you have worked hard to maintain your speed and remain an integral part of the team. Lately, Santa has stated that she will be making some changes to increase the speed of the sleigh team, and while you have never felt that your position on the sleigh team was threatened, that has changed.<br><br>
            To ease the stress of your job, you and Rudolph decided to partake in drinking a few cartons of eggnog the other night. After drinking the eggnog, you went on a joy ride, which ended in a terrible accident when you haphazardly trampled Hermey leaving him in a coma. Not wanting to further put your job in jeopardy, you quickly and quietly left the scene of the accident. When you returned to the barn where you and Rudolph had been drinking, you found Rudolph passed out and brought him home. Knowing that Rudolph had no memory of your joyride alone, you and Rudolph vowed to alibi for each other, since you would be reprimanded severely for your eggnog drinking habits. The two of you decided to claim you were working together on speed drills at the time of the accident. While you convinced Rudolph to be your alibi, you plan to incriminate him in the crime in order to save your spot on the sleigh team. Since Rudolph has become the slowest and laziest reindeer on the sleigh team, if you are able to frame Rudolph, he will be removed from the team and you will be doing everyone a favor. Additionally, while Bouncy wishes to replace Rudolph, Jingle  will never voluntarily replace Rudolph, so this may be the only way to remove Rudolph and save your job.<br><br>
            In your quest to incriminate Rudolph, you have taken notice of those who can help and hurt your cause. You believe Connie Claus may make the perfect ally. Connie is known to be very jealous of the relationships Santa has with Rudolph, Kristy Krangle and Jingle. With this natural dislike, you believe Connie will do anything to reveal her mother's confidants as untrustworthy characters. Consequently, you have taken notice of those especially close to Rudolphâ€”mainly Kristy Krangle. The other day you witnessed what you believe was Kristy and Rudolph making a deal, and you are fearful that Rudolph may be selling your secrets.<br><br> 
            As the Holly, Jolly Christmas Party approaches, you are looking forward to the event. With everyone in attendance you believe that it will be the perfect place for you to incriminate Rudolph. Additionally, you are looking forward to celebrating the season and enjoying some eggnog!

            For the party, you will dress in your reindeer attire, which may include brown clothing, antlers, a collar and, possibly, your most festive Christmas sweater. It is imperative you DO NOT wear any jingle bells.
