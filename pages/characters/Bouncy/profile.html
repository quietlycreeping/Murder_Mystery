          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            As the elf in charge of the reindeer, you take this responsibility very seriously. Among your duties, you feed and exercise all of the reindeer making sure that 
            they are all in good enough shape to swiftly guide Santa's sleigh come Christmas Eve night. While the North Pole is home to many reindeer, there is only enough 
            room on the sleigh team for the fastest nine reindeer. Thus, there is always a great deal of competition for the sleigh team. Even though you have considerable 
            influence in selecting the sleigh team, the ultimate decision lies with Santaâ€”who often looks to Jingle for guidance.<br><br>

            While you have enjoyed your job immensely for many years, lately it has become stressful. With the increasing global population of children and rising demand for 
            toys each year, Santa is trying to increase both toy production and sleigh speed so she is able to deliver more toys to more houses. Knowing this, you have recommended 
            that Rudolph be removed from the sleigh team and replaced by Dusty, which will increase sleigh speed. Over the years, Rudolph's celebrity status has made him difficult 
            to work with. Currently, Rudolph has been refusing to participate in speed drills and long training rides. This angers you and the other reindeer, which is why you would 
            like Rudolph removed from the team. However, Jingle has refused to listen to your recommendations saying that Rudolph is an invaluable part of Santa's legacy and cannot 
            be replaced. While you can respect that fact, you fear that you will lose your job if Jingle does not replace Rudolph.<br><br>

            In addition to the pressure to increase sleigh speed, Ivy has closely questioned you about which reindeer trampled her husband, Hermey, leaving him in a coma. Ivy is 
            determined to find the culprit and bring them to justice. Santa has announced that the culprit will not be a member of the sleigh team in the future. While Jingle is leading 
            the investigation, Ivy is intent on speeding up the process and making sure it is a fair proceeding. This further complicates your position, since you cannot afford to lose 
            one of your fastest reindeer, like Comet, from the sleigh team.<br><br>

            As the Holly, Jolly Christmas Party approaches, you are looking forward to attending. While Santa usually confides in Jingle, at the party you hope that you can convince Santa 
            that Rudolph needs to be replaced to make the Christmas Eve sleigh team faster. Additionally, you cannot wait to celebrate the spirit of the season with your fellow North Pole companions!

          <h4>Acting Your Part</h4>
          <p>Confident that you are doing what is best for the reindeer and Santa's sleigh, you will be bold and assertive in your actions and discussions at the party. While you don't want to appear disgruntled, you will make it clear that you and Jingle do not agree on who should be on the sleigh team.</p>

          <h4>Costumes Suggestions</h4>
          <p>
            For the party, you will dress in your seasonal and festive elf attire. Among things you will want to consider for your outfit are: striped stockings, Christmas sweaters, Christmas-themed accessories, a vest, curve-toed shoes, pointed ears, a hat, and red and green accessories. Along with your attire, you may want to bring reindeer feed and/or treats along with some leashes or a harness.
