          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            As a reindeer, there is nothing you want more than to be awarded a coveted position on the Christmas Eve sleigh team. Since you were a young and powerful doe, 
            you have aspired to be one of the fastest reindeer at the North Pole. This year, you believed, would be the year you were promoted. Santa has made it clear that 
            she wishes to increase the speed of the sleigh in order to increase productivity. You were certain your speed would earn you a position this year.<br><br>

            While Bouncy agrees that you have earned a position on the team, Jingle will not suggest the promotion to Santa since you would be replacing Rudolph. 
            As Santa has grown dependent on Rudolph over the years, Rudolph has grown lazy and slow. Rudolph's laziness angers Bouncy, who is in charge of keeping the sleigh speed 
            fast, but Jingle refuses to replace Rudolph despite the fact that he is a detriment to the sleigh's fast pace.<br><br>

            Afraid of losing her position on the sleigh team due to pace, you have agreed to help Cupid with her speed. Secretly, the two of you have been sneaking off to practice speed 
            drills in your free time. At first, you thought Cupid might fancy you, but you have since learned that her heart belongs to Comet.<br><br> 

            Despite many setbacks, you have discovered that there may be a potential opening on the sleigh team. Just last week, Hermey was trampled by a reindeer, leaving Hermey in a coma. 
            Since the guilty party has not stepped forward and admitted responsibility, there has been much outrage in the North Pole community. Santa has put Jingle in charge of the investigation 
            into the matter and has vowed to remove the guilty reindeer from any flying privileges once found. Knowing that Jingle is in charge, you are certain the investigation will be biased, 
            which is why you plan to step in and help to investigate the accident. If you can help find and prove the culprit to be Rudolph, or another member of the sleigh team, you believe you will 
            have your deserved position on the team.<br><br>

            As the Holly, Jolly Christmas Party approaches, you are happy to attend. You believe the party will be a perfect place for you to inquire into Hermey's accident and fully expose any improprieties 
            in Jingle's investigation. Additionally, you hope to uncover evidence that will undoubtedly prove Rudolph's guiltâ€”removing him from the sleigh team!

          <h4>Acting Your Part</h4>
          <p>As an ambitious, young doe, you are anxious and excited to attend the party. While at the party, you will want to both please those you meet and assure everyone that you deserve to be on the sleigh 
            team, no matter how you are chosen! Since you are allergic to eggnog, you will need to abstain from drinking it while at the party.
